Written by: Lars Fyhr (lcf597)

Instructions:

1. Unzip the contents of this file into project directory (do not need the readme.txt)
    -includes makefile, driver.c, stack312_ll.c, stack312_ll.h

2. Type "make" into the command prompt while in the project directory
    -if you "ls" in the directory, you should now have a "flood_fill" executable, as well as two object files

3. Enter the command "./floodfill testcase.txt" into the command prompt while still in project directory
    -"testcase.txt" is any correctly formatted (same rows/columns, no random special chars) test case under the bounds of 25x25 (excludes \n)
    -Also, the final line of the "text picture" (AKA the last line with contents should be "\n" terminated to create a new empty line)
